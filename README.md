# [Beanstalk](https://beanstalkd.github.io/): a simple, fast work queue.

`Beanstalk` is a simple, fast work queue.

Its interface is generic, but was originally designed for reducing the latency of page views in high-volume web applications by running time-consuming tasks asynchronously.

## How to use

```bash
# Run a Beanstalkd server

$ docker run -d --name beanstalkd touchify/beanstalkd
```

## Environments variables

You can configure the beanstalkd instance using environment variables:

| Environment variable      | Default   | Description
| ------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------
| BEANSTALKD_PORT           | 11300     | The port to listen on
| BEANSTALKD_FSYNC_INTERVAL | 50        | `fsync` at most once every MS milliseconds. *Use `0` for "always fsync"*
| BEANSTALKD_FSYNC_DISABLE  |           | Set to `1` to disable `fsync`
| BEANSTALKD_LOG_ENABLE     |           | Set to `1` to enable write-head log
| BEANSTALKD_LOG_DIR        | `/var/cache/beanstalkd` | Write-ahead log directory
| BEANSTALKD_LOG_SIZE       | 10485760  | Set the size of each write-ahead log. *Will be rounded up to a multiple of 4096 bytes*
| BEANSTALKD_JOB_MAX_SIZE   | 65535     | Set the maximum job size in bytes. *max allowed is 1073741824 bytes*
| BEANSTALKD_VERBOSE        |           | Set to `1` to enable verbosity
